## Steps
1. Document your assumptions
2. Explain your approach
3. Provide code comments
4. Explain the big-O
5. Identify any additional data structures
6. Only provide your best answer

- Selection Sort
- Quick sort
- Merge sort
- Call stack
## Binary search 
(can be used to find the closest number)

## Queue, Stack and LinkedList  
Queue: FIFO = First in first out  
Stack: LIFO = Last in first out

## Binary Tree & Binary Search Tree  
- Balanced binary tree
- Complete binary tree
- Binary search tree

## Heap & Graph Search Algorithm  

Heap Property:  
- every element of the tree is larger than any of its descendants if they exists.
- complete binary tree
- Max Heap, Min Heap
- Index of lchild= index of parent X*2 +1
- Index of rchild= index of parent X*2 +2
- Unsorted but follow rules above  

Heap operation:
- insert: O(logn)
- update: O(logn)
- get/top: O(1)
- pop: O(logn)
- heapify: unsorted array to Heap, O(n)

Graph searchï¼š 
- Breadth-first search (BFS-1)
